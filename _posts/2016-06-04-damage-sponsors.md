title:      Detailed Damage, Sponsors, and UI Reworks
summary:    We've rolled out a new tab - damage.
---

We've rolled out a new tab - [damage](https://yasp.co/matches/2406464848/damage). While we have long shown
damage done via skills, we're now breaking down the damage received. Use this tab to figure out why you're dying so fast,
and maybe change your play and item builds in response. Now you can see how Zeus managed to go 31-2. Yeah.
He did a lot of damage to you.

-------

We're also proud to announce our first official corporate sponsor: <https://www.jist.tv/>. We've all seen
highlight videos of pro matches. Now, you can have your own video highlights, just like your 9K MMR deserves. Jist
lets you easily make videos from your match replays, through replay upload or, now, through the Jist button on each
YASP match page. You can watch these replays on mobile or any browser, easily share them with friends, 
and watch other usersâ€™ replays.

Jist is an example of exactly the kind of partership we're looking for for YASP. Jist integrates nicely and obviously
with YASP and what we're doing -- what better way to analyze a match than to actually watch it? And obviously, the partership
keeps our servers running, so that we can continue to provide a powerful service for free and to as many users as possible.

If you're interested in a sponsorship, or have an idea on othe revenue streams we can persue to keep YASP running,
send us an email to <support@yasp.co>.

Finally, we're working on rewriting our front end and our UI. It's a work in progress, but you can follow it <http://ui.yasp.co/>.

One of the most major complaints we've seen about YASP has been its UI, so we're really hoping to improve it. If you have
any suggestions, hit us up on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/0o5SQGbXuWCNDcaF).

Thanks for your continued support!
