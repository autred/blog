It's been a quiet summer for YASP, but we're back with some new features, just in time for TI!

### Compendium Predictions

Stats are useful because you can use them to predict the future. We've taken a look at all the pro games in 6.88 to give
you the best chance of getting your predictions right! Check out our insights [here](https://yasp.co/ti6predictions).

### "Pros" tab
A new tab on each player page now shows the games that that player has played with professional players!
The list is from a Steam API endpoint called GetProPlayerList.

### Denies @ 10
This stat is now available on match pages! A huge Thank You to community developer [@lomash](https://github.com/lomash)
for implementing this feature!!! See how it was done [here](https://github.com/yasp-dota/yasp/pull/1074).

### Ranking Update
We've updated our [ranking system](https://yasp.co/rankings) to more accurately rank the best players at the top. 

We've increased weighting of MMR again for the 2016Q3 ranking cycle, which started 2016-07-01. Essentially, a player 
with half the MMR of another player now needs 64 times as many wins to have the same ranking score.

And as always, we're always improving our infrastructure to improve site reliability and performance.

### Welcome, Cassandra!
After a lengthy migration, we've moved over 1.2 billion matches from PostgreSQL to a 4-node Cassandra cluster.
We're seeing *over 98% of requests served in under a second*! Yay! This is a huge improvement over the performance we were 
seeing with PostgreSQL. Now, load times scale linearly with the number of matches processed, so player pages with lots of 
matches (~5000+) might have slightly slower times, but this is still much better than the 15-30 second times from before!

Native support for compression has also cut our disk space usage in half! We were even able to switch to HDD storage for a 
4x reduction in storage costs. All this means future savings.

### Isolated Infrastructure
We moved Postgres, Redis, and each Cassandra node to their own separate compute instances to prevent them from contending for 
memory, which had previously been causing random crashes.
