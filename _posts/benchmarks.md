Today we're pushing out [global performance benchmarks](/benchmarks). See how every hero performs across all player skill levels 
in a variety of stats, including last hits, GPM, and kills.

We also automatically compute these benchmarks for each player in a match. Check out how you performed with your hero
compared to other Dota players on each [match page](https://yasp.co/matches/2279672530/benchmarks).

Have questions or feedback?  Come chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/0o5SQGbXuWCNDcaF).

As always, all of our code remains fully [open source](https://github.com/yasp-dota/yasp) and maintained entirely by volunteers. 
Want to help out/gain some experience working on an open-source project?  We'd love your help, and we'd love 
to help you get started!

YASP also remains completely crowd funded. Last month, the generous Dota 2 community came out in droves to
support YASP financially, giving us over $3000 in donations! All proceeds go fully towards our server costs.
Want to help out? Check out our [carry](/carry) page. Everyone wants to be a carry :) Even better, you'll
be a support at the same time!

Thank you everyone for all your support!
