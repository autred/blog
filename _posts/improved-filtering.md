Happy May!

We're pushing out a small, but powerful update today: top matches.

Even veteran YASP users might not be aware of our filtering feature. On a player profile you can click the "Apply A Filter"
button to narrow down your results. Remember playing an awesome Zeus game but now you can't find it? Want to know your
winrate when Axe and CM are on your team? How do you fare playing with your friends?

Now, we've added the top matches option. First, select the number of matches you want then select
the statistic you want to order by. These include kills, GPM, and duration. Yes, you can even
filter by deaths to see when you fed the most.

You've played a lot of matches. Now see which ones are the top.

Thanks for your continued support!
