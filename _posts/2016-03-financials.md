We started YASP with one goal in mind: free Dota 2 statistics for everyone who wants them.

So far, we've done a pretty good job.

* 100,000+ YASP users, 35,000+ active
* 50,000+ parsed matches a day

And we've done it without ads or subscription accounts. We've ran completely from generous
user donations. (Full disclosure: we did have ads for the initial months, but we removed them for a
better site experience.)

But as the number of users and matches has grown so have our server costs. Meanwhile, revenue has stagnated.

Last month, February, we spent $987 on servers on $578 of net donations ($638 total, we generally lose ~10% from fees).
A breakdown of expendatures can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/dLZMg).

This month, we're looking at server costs of about $1300, meaning we need around $1400 in donations to break even.
While it's a big increase, there are a lot of good reasons for it:
  * Increased stability
  * To support an influx of new users
  * Scaling up our hard drives for our ever increasing data
  * And preparing for cool new features coming in April

To be clear, we operate completely not-for-profit. All income we get we invest straight back into hosting YASP. All
devs, team members, and contributors receive no compensation.

We want to keep YASP ad-free for as long as possible. We believe our users and their data shouldn't be products!

**So we need your help to keep YASP running. If everyone who read this gave $1, we'd reach our goal in half a day.**

Thanks,

The YASP team
