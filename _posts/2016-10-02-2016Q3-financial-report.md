## Summary

OpenDota has now just over $2000 lifetime earnings. Sponsorships and advertising have really
brought in some revenue for us which has now given us a small rainy-day fund for now. We hope
that this revenue maintains itself so that we have more income stability and more money to invest
in improving OpenDota.
