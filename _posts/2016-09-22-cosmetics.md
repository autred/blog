Wow, that PA looked so cool! I wonder what she was wearing...

Never fear; OpenDota is here! One new feature pushed tonight: we've added a listing on the match pages of all the cosmetic items present in that match (organized by the player owning the particular cosmetic). A nice example can be seen here at [/matches/matchID/**cosmetics**](https://www.opendota.com/matches/2660724143/cosmetics).

Here's to hoping that you'll never again be plagued by hollow memories of a Hat u wish u had! :') Cheers,

~ The OpenDota Team
