There is a setting in the Dota 2 client called "Expose Public Match Data".
It is off by default, and if not enabled, your account_id is hidden in the Dota 2 API, so we can't identify you as the player who played in the match (although we still have a record of the match itself).
Once enabled, any matches played after that point should show up in your profile.
