This started as a side project of a couple of college students and it still operates that way.
We don't intend to make a profit from it, although we try to at least break even on the server bills.
We're also happy to share our knowledge with the community by completely open-sourcing the entire site and stack we run it on.

Development is done by volunteers contributing in their free time, so we don't have employees to pay.
Donations from users pay for servers.
